//  Use this file to import your target's public headers that you would like to expose to Swift.

// 1)  *** TUTORIAL FIRST ELEMENT ***
//I wanted to import an objective C header form Parse. So I went ahead and created a new objective C file.
//X-code asked me if I wanted to create a bridging header. I said yes. I deleted the .m file that was
//created and I am now working with the bridging error.
//Now I can do all objective-C imports for Parse and they will strealessly integrate to swift
#include<Parse/Parse.h>

//Now move on to app delegate page and make the necessary changes as described.
